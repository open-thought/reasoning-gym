  "answer": "John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.\nThey then arrive at the fire station and have 24 - 13 = <<24-13=11>>11 minutes left to get to school without being late.\n#### 11",

  "answer_annotated": "{n1} and {n2} go from home to {loc3} in {t1} minutes + {t2} minutes = {t1+t2} minutes.\nSince they have to return home again, they will spend {t1+t2} minutes more to reach home. Once they have their wallets, they will come back to {loc3} again from which will take another {t1+t2} minutes.
