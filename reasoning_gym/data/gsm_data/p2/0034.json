  "question": "Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?",
  "answer": "Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.\n#### 118000",
