  "answer": "There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.\nThe chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.\nThe difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.\n#### 25",
