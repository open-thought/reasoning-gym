  "question": "Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought 4 pens which cost $1.5 each, 2 notebooks which cost $4 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?",
  "answer": "Raphael spent 4 x $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6 for the pens.\nHe also spent 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8 for the notebooks.\nTherefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6+8+20=34>>34 for the school supplies.\n#### 34",

  "answer_annotated": "{name} spent {n1} x {cur}{c1} = {cur}<<{n1}*{c1}={int(n1*c1)}>>{int(n1*c1)} for the {obj1}.\nHe also spent {n2} x {cur}{c2} = {cur}<<{n2}*{c2}={int(n2*c2)}>>{int(n2*c2)} for the {obj2}.\nTherefore, {name} spent a total of {cur}{int(n1*c1)} + {cur}{int(n2*c2)} + {cur}{c3} = {cur}<<{int(n1*c1)}+{int(n2*c2)}+{c3}={int(n1*c1+n2*c2+c3)}>>{int(n1*c1+n2*c2+c3)} for the school supplies.\nFinally we should include {n4} * {c4} = {(n4 )* c4}. The total will be be {int(n1*c1+n2*c2+c3)+(n4)*c4}\nIf {name} becomes a member he gets 20% discount, which will be {cur}{int(n1*c1+n2*c2+c3)+(n4)*c4} * 20% = {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.2)} discount. He also has to pay {cur}20 so it will be {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.2)} - {cur}20 = {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.2)-20} cheaper.\nIf {name} doesn't become a member, get only gets 5% discount, which will be {cur}{int(n1*c1+n2*c2+c3)+(n4)*c4} * 5% = {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.05)}. Since {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.05)} is smaller than {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.2)-20}, to pay the least, {name} has to become member. \nSo overall he pays {cur}{int(n1*c1+n2*c2+c3)+(n4)*c4} - {cur}{int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+(n4)*c4)*0.2)-20} = {cur}{ int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+n4*c4)*0.8) + 20}\n#### {int((n1*c1 + n2*c2 + c3+n4*c4)*0.8) + 20}"
