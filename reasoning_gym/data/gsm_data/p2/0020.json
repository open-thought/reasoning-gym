  "question": "John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. How many bananas does John have?",
  "answer": "Combining Wednesday and Thursday, John has 4 bananas + 6 bananas = <<4+6=10>>10 bananas.\nOn Friday, he picks 3 * 4 bananas = <<3*4=12>>12 bananas.\nAltogether, John has 10 bananas + 12 bananas = <<10+12=22>>22 bananas.\n#### 22",
