  "question": "Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?",
  "answer": "The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.\nThe total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.\nThe total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.\nTherefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.\n#### 694",
