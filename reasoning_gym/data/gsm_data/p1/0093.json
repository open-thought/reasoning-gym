  "question": "When the water is cold Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?",
  "answer": "Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes\nWarm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes\n3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes\n3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes\nRay takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer\n#### 54",
