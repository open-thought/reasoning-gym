  "question": "John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?",
  "answer": "John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.\nIn total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip\nTherefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.\n#### 100",
