  "question": "Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",
  "answer": "The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20\nSince the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42\n#### 42",
