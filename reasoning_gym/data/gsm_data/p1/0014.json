  "answer": "John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.\nThey then arrive at the fire station and have 24 - 13 = <<24-13=11>>11 minutes left to get to school without being late.\n#### 11",

It takes them another {t2,13} minutes to get to the {loc3, fire station}. It will then take {mult,double} the combined amount they have spent so far to reach the {loc4, grocery store}. How much longer do they have to get to {loc1,school} without being late, if they have already wasted {waste,10} minutes to get a coffee before their walk?\n\n#init:\n- n1, n2 = sample(names, 2)\n- loc1, loc2, loc3, loc4 = sample(['cinema', 'mall', 'library', 'park', 'gym', 'bank', 'grocery store'], 4)\n- $t1 = range(10, 30)\n- $t2 = range(10, 70)\n- $t = range(130, 270)\n- $waste = range(22, 54)\n- $mult = sample(multiple)\n\n#conditions:\n- not divides(t1, 5)\n- not divides(t2, 5)\n- not divides(t, 5)\n- t > (t1 + t2)*(1+mult) + waste\n\n#answer: t - waste - ((t1 + t2)*(1+mult))",
