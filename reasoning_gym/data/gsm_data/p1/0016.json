  "question": "Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?",
  "answer": "He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.\nSunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.\nHe earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.\nSo, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.\n#### 540",
