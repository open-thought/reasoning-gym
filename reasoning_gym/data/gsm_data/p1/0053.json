  "question": "Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. How many points did Pierson and Nikita have in total?",
  "answer": "Pierson = <<278=278>>278 points\nNikita = (1/2) 278 + 11 = 150 points\n278 + 150 = <<278+150=428>>428 points\nTogether, Pierson and Nikita scored 428 points.\n#### 428",
