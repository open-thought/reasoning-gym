  "question": "A class of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?",
  "answer": "The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10\nThe number that like to play video games is 50 total students - 10 baking - 5 basketball - 10 music = <<50-10-5-10=25>>25\n#### 25",
