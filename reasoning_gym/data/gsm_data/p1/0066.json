  "answer": "First find the number of blue spools: 15 spools + 45 spools = <<15+45=60>>60 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 60 spools = <<40+50+60=150>>150 spools\nThen divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 spools / 150 spools * 100% = 40%\n#### 40",
