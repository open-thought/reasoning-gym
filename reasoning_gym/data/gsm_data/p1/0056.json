  "question": "A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.  John drinks 2 glasses of milk.  If milk has 3 calories per ounce how many calories did he consume?",
  "answer": "He drank 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 ounces of milk\nSo he drank 16*3=<<16*3=48>>48 calories of milk\n#### 48",

  "answer_annotated": "{name} drank {vol}*{num}=<<{vol}*{num}={vol*num}>>{vol*num} {unit} of {liquid}.\n{name} used {tsp} per {container}. So he ate {num} * {tsp} teaspoons of sugar. \nSo he drank {vol*num}*{cal}=<<{vol*num}*{cal}={vol*num*cal}>>{vol*num*cal} calories of {liquid}. \nHe also added {tsp} teaspoons of sugar to each {container}.
