  "question": "Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?",
  "answer": "While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.\nIn a day, they process 100 orders/day + 50 orders/day = <<100+50=150>>150 orders together.\nThe total number of orders the two processes in a week is 150 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<150*7=1050>>1050 orders\n#### 1050",
