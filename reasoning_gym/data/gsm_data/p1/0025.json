  "question": "In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  How many students are leaving early?",
  "answer": "20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students\nThere are 30 students and 6 are football players so that leaves 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 students\n25% of the remaining 24 students are part of band or cheerleading so that's .25*24 = <<.25*24=6>>6 students\n6 students are football players and 6 are part of band/cheerleading so 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 students will be leaving early\n#### 12",
