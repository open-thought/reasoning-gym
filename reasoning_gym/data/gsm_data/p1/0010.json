  "question": "To make a call from a payphone, you must pay $0.25 for each minute of your call. After 16 minutes, that price drops to $0.2 per minute. How much would a 36-minute call cost?",
  "answer": "First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nAfter that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.\nSo in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.\n#### 8",

  "answer_annotated": "First {t} minutes would be a cost of {t} * {frac1} = {currency}<<{t}*{frac1}={int(t*frac1)}>>{int(t*frac1)}.\nAfter that, the next {t2} - {t} = <<{t2}-{t}={t2-t}>>{t2-t} minutes of the call will cost {frac2}.\nAnd these {t2-t} minutes cost {t2-t} * {frac2} = {currency}<<{t2-t}*{frac2}={int((t2-t)*frac2)}>>{int((t2-t)*frac2)}.\nThen from {t2} to {total}, there are {total}-{t2}={total-t2} minutes that cost {frac3} per two minutes.
