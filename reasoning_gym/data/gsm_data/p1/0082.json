  "answer": "There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.\nAfter an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.\nThis means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.\nOut of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.\n#### 8",
