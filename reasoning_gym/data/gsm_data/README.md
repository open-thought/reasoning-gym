# GSM Symbolic data

The template data here were culled from here[https://github.com/apple/ml-gsm-symbolic]

- `Symbolic`: This represents templates of GSM8K-test data. It would be used here to generate arbitrary samples by replacing proper names and values in the original GSM8K-test data
- `p1`: This would be used to add one clause to original GSM8K-test data in order to change the difficulty of the question.
- `p2`: This would be used to add two clauses to original GSM8K-test data in order to change the difficulty of the question.
