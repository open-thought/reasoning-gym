    "question": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?",
    "answer": "Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.\nArtie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.\nArtie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.\nArtie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36\nArtie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18\nArtie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34\nAltogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88\n#### 88",
