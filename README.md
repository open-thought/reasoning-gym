# Reasoning Gym

We are building a python library of procedural dataset generators and algorithmically verifibale reasoning environments for training Reasoning Models with reinforcement learning (RL).

The goal is to generate virtually infinite data with adjustable complexity.


### Generator / Environment Ideas 

- math tasks
- alogrithmic tasks (counting, sorting, re-ordering, ..)
- logic riddles
- logic inductive programming tasks
- ARC-AGI synthetic riddles


## Call for Contributons

If you have ideas for additional procedural dataset generators or please create an issue here.

Or contact us in the `#arc-agi-2` channel of the [GPU-Mode discord server](https://discord.gg/gpumode).
