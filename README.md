# Reasoning Gym

We are building a python library of procedural dataset generators and algorithmically verifiable reasoning environments for training Reasoning Models with reinforcement learning (RL).

The goal is to generate virtually infinite data with adjustable complexity.


### Generator / Environment Ideas

- math tasks
- algorithmic tasks (counting, sorting, re-ordering, ..)
- logic riddles
- logic inductive programming tasks
- ARC-AGI synthetic riddles


## Call for Contributions
