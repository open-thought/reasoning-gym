# Config used for evaluating inter-domain generalisation experiment models on graphs test data

# Models evaluated on this config:
# Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (original model)
# inter_logic_qwen_3b_400 (original + 400 GRPO steps on logic RG data)
# inter_games_qwen_3b_500 (original + 500 GRPO steps on games RG data)

model_path: ../models/inter_games_qwen_3b_500  # Change to the model to be evaluated

max_tokens: 2048  # From max_response_length in training config
top_p: 0.9  # From rollout top_p
temperature: 0.6  # Lower temperature for more focused responses
