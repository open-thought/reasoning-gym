Specifically, the number of distinct ways to climb `n` steps, where you can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time, is equal to the `(n+1)`-th Fibonacci number.\\n\\nGiven the output `27777890035288`, we need to find the integer `n` such that the `(n+1)`-th Fibonacci number is `27777890035288`.\\n\\nThe Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, and the number `27777890035288` is a very large Fibonacci number. To find the corresponding `n`, we can use the fact that the Fibonacci sequence follows the recurrence relation:\\n\\n\\\\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \\\\]\\n\\nGiven that `F(73) = 806515533049393` and `F(72) = 498454011879264`, it is clear that `27777890035288` is much smaller than `F(73)`. We need to find the exact `n` such that `F(n+1) = 27777890035288`.\\n\\nHowever, calculating Fibonacci numbers manually for large `n` is impractical. Instead, we can use the fact that `F(75) = 2111485077978050`, which is larger than `27777890035288`. Therefore, the `n` we are looking for must be between 72 and 75.\\n\\nBy checking Fibonacci numbers closer to `27777890035288`, we find that:\\n\\n\\\\[ F(74) = 1304969544928657 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ F(75) = 2111485077978050 \\\\]\\n\\nSince `27777890035288` is significantly larger than `F(74)` but smaller than `F(75)`, it is clear that `n` is 74.\\n\\nThus, the input `number_of_steps` should be 74, which corresponds to `F(75) = 27777890035288`.\\n\\nTherefore, the feasible input is:\\n\\n```json\\n{\"number_of_steps\": 74}\\n```'"

       "'To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase with `number_of_steps` steps, where you can either take 1 or 2 steps at a time. This problem is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem and is very similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\\n\\n### Reasoning:\\n- The number of distinct ways to climb `n` steps is equal to the sum of the number of distinct ways to climb `n-1` steps and the number of distinct ways to climb `n-2` steps. This is because from the `n-1`th step, you can take a single step to reach the `n`th step, and from the `n-2`th step, you can take two steps to reach the `n`th step.\\n- The base cases are:\\n  - For `n = 1`, there is only 1 way to climb the staircase (taking a single step).\\n  - For `n = 2`, there are 2 ways to climb the staircase (taking two single steps or one double step).\\n\\nThe number of distinct ways to climb `n` steps follows the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\\n- F(0) = 0\\n- F(1) = 1\\n- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n ≥ 2\\n\\nHowever, in our problem, the number of ways to climb `n` steps corresponds to F(n+1) in the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\\n- For `n = 1` (F(2)), there is 1 way.\\n- For `n = 2` (F(3)), there are 2 ways.\\n- For `n = 3` (F(4)), there are 3 ways.\\n- For `n = 4` (F(5)), there are 5 ways.\\n\\nGiven `number_of_steps = 19`, we need to calculate F(20).\\n\\nThe Fibonacci sequence up to F(20) is as follows:\\n- F(0) = 0\\n- F(1) = 1\\n- F(2) = 1\\n- F(3) = 2\\n- F(4) = 3\\n- F(5) = 5\\n- F(6) = 8\\n- F(7) = 13\\n- F(8) = 21\\n- F(9) = 34\\n- F(10) = 55\\n- F(11) = 89\\n- F(12) = 144\\n- F(13) = 233\\n- F(14) = 377\\n- F(15) = 610\\n- F(16) = 987\\n- F(17) = 1597\\n- F(18) = 2584\\n- F(19) = 4181\\n- F(20) = 6765\\n\\nTherefore, the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase with 19 steps is 6765.\\n\\n### Final Answer:\\n```json\\n{\"output\": {\"distinct_ways\": 6765}}\\n```'"
