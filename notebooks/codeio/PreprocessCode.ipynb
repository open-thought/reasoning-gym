    "- a query, converting the reference code into a question (along the lines of \"given [function parameters...] how can we obtain [desired outputs...]\")\n",

    "- an input generator, which can generate a dictionary of valid inputs for the function\n",

    "You are tasked with preprocessing a raw file of Python code into a standard format. The format is made up of several components. Here is a very simple example of a raw code file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def kg_to_pounds(weights):\n",
    "    return [w * 2.20462 for w in weights]\n",
    "\n",
    "def filter_weekly(original_measurements, days):\n",

    "    for measurement in filter_weekly(lbs, days):\n",
    "        print(measurement)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cleaned reference code, with a main entrypoint function that takes all required arguments as parameters and returns all outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the main entrypoint function should be `main`. The parameters should be clearly named but do not require type hints. The function should return a dict mapping output names to values. The function should contain all the necessary code to perform the functionality, without splitting into several functions. The function should not print or otherwise output anything; results should be returned as part of the result dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example function signature: `def main(weights_kg, days):`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A query, defined as natural language description of the question the function answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example query: \"You are given two lists of integers, `weights_kg` and `days`. The unit of `weights_kg` is kilograms. `days` refers to the number of days passed, starting from zero. Your task is to convert the integers to pounds and filter to only one weight measurement every 7 days. Return the list of integers in pounds.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The query should be as detailed as the code requires to be fully explained. It should be clear what the function does, what the inputs are, and what the outputs are.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A natural language description of all inputs (function parameters) and outputs (return values) of the function.\n",

    "4. Python 3.11 code for an input generator, which randomly generates valid sets of inputs for the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input generator should return a dict mapping parameter names to values. The values should be randomly generated, but should be valid inputs for the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example input generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def input_generator():\n",
    "    weights = [np.random.uniform(0, 100) for _ in range(40)]\n",
