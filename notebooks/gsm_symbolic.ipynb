    "Here is a the SOURCE item from the dataset which you should translate into a python generator:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see we have already `question_annotated` and `answer_annotated`, but they are not really native python functions. The variable names have these `$` prefixes etc. Could you generate python code which would generate synthetic questions and answers, i.e. with numerical variables from some ranges which would make sense for the given case? Beside the question and answer I also need some metadata e.g. in a dict about the variables used.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to use the generator function later to generate many different variants of of questions and answers based on the same template.\n",
    "To control the difficulty I want to provide a floating point `difficulty` factor which could be used to scale the numeric ranges .. but please ensure the values integers (e.g cast back to int). If there are variables for which no values are provided like male_names, objects etc. please generate a list of values to sample from that fits  in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To make it modular and testable let's split the generator into one function called `generate_from_variables()` which gets the input variables and generates the question and answer texts. It should calculate the answer value from the inputs and the main randomized generator `generate_example()` (see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The generator function should have a signature like`def generate_example(rng: Random, difficulty: float = 1.0) -> dict`.\n",

    "The output dict should contain:\n",
